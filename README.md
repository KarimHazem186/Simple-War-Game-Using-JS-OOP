# Simple-War-Game-Using-JS-OOP
This is a simple war game built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript. The game features two characters: **Nartoo** and **Sasakii**, who engage in combat by attacking each other until one player's health reaches zero. The game utilizes JavaScript classes and methods to implement the game logic.

## Features:

- **OOP Structure**: The game is built using JavaScript's Object-Oriented Programming concepts. Characters (Nartoo and Sasakii) are represented as objects with properties and methods.
- **Attack and Health**: Each character has an attack power and a health bar. Players take turns attacking each other, reducing health points.
- **Simple Game Flow**: The game continues until one player's health drops to zero, signifying the end of the game.
